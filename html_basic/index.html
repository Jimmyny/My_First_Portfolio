        <h1>This is my First Portfolio</h1>
        <p>As part of the requirement for the completion of my FE SE course with ALX, I have to have a good understanding of HTML and how to use it fully for work.</p>
        <p>It is also rather hard to remeber all of the elements, tags and attributes right now, but I'll get there</p>
        <h2>Learning Platform</h2>

        <h3>The Goals</h3>
        <p>The goal of this course is to be master the skill so as to live a more independent and fulfiled life</p>
        <p>Here is a link to a file where I embedded a twitter post; <a href="file:///C:/Users/train/git-practical/html_basic/tweets.html">tweets.html</a> I was really excited about it</p>
